      <p className="paragraph">
        We call the new science, built on the foundation of several modern and
        classical disciplines, neocybernetics. We are a neocybernetics company
        using the new science and technology to revolutionize finance,
        insurance, transportation, shipping, and medicine in the United Kingdom
        and worldwide. Neocybernetics is built on: data science machine learning
        (ML) deep learning (DL) reinforcement learning (RL) deep reinforcement
        learning (DRL) artificial intelligence (AI) big data high-frequency data
        analysis markets microstructure quantitative finance electronic trading
        algorithmic trading real-time computing high-performance computing
        reactive programming message-driven architectures low-latency messaging
        TIME SERIES Among other things, we apply neocybernetics to time
        series–sequences of timestamped updates, arriving in chronological
        order, on the state of a particular process evolving over time. Example
        applications: stock prices interest rates currency exchange rates,
        including cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin micro- and macroeconomic
        data states of a particular machine, e.g. in a car, on a ship, airplane,
        or on a space station electrocardiogram (ECG) tests electroencephalogram
        (EEG) tests at the microscopic level, metabolic chain states any medical
        test results as they evolve over time fitband readings DATA SCIENCE Data
        science is the art, craft, and science of making sense of data. And not
        only making sense, but drawing nontrivial and practically useful
        conclusions, that can be (and must be!) constructively acted upon to
        achieve better outcomes. It is important because we desperately need
        those better outcomes–as a species and as individual persons. We live in
        the age of data science. Whatever your business, the ability to learn
        more about your customers, and about your customers’ demands enables you
        to optimize your marketing and sales, and to provide a better offering,
        thus increasing your profitability. Data science is driven by the rise
        in the availability and quality of data and computational resources. You
        can use data science to improve patients’ outcomes, your town’s
        security, find gold, oil, and other commodities, optimize ship and
        airplane traffic, and energy consumption; you can look at the big
        picture and take into account the finest, nano scale. Whatever the type
        of your organization, you can use data science to achieve the maximum
        level of efficiency. Companies such as Amazon.com, Inc.; Apple Inc.;
        Facebook Inc.; Google LLC; Roofoods Ltd (branded as Deliveroo); Uber
        Technologies, Inc. can all be thought of as data science companies
        because their business edge comes from their ability to collect,
        process, and take advantage of, data. 数据科学
        数据科学是理解数据的艺术、工艺和科学。不仅有意义，而且得出重要且实际有用的结论，可以（而且必须！）建设性地采取行动以取得更好的结果。这很重要，因为我们迫切需要那些更好的结果——作为一个物种和个人。
        我们生活在数据科学时代。无论您从事何种业务，如果能够更多地了解您的客户和客户的需求，就可以优化您的营销和销售，提供更好的产品，从而提高您的盈利能力。数据科学是由数据和计算资源的可用性和质量的提高驱动。
        您可以使用数据科学来改善患者的治疗效果、您所在城镇的安全、寻找黄金、石油和其他商品，优化船舶和飞机交通以及能源消耗；您可以着眼大局并考虑到最精细的纳米级。无论您的组织属于何种类型，您都可以使用数据科学来实现最高水平的效率。
        Amazon.com, Inc. 等公司；苹果公司。;脸书公司；谷歌有限责任公司；
        Roofoods Ltd（品牌为 Deliveroo）； Uber Technologies, Inc.
        都可以被视为数据科学公司，因为他们的业务优势来自于他们收集、处理和利用数据的能力。

      <h2 className="secondary-title-2">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) was first defined by John McCarthy as “the
      science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially
      intelligent computer programs”. The early researchers in AI set the target
      very high: they aimed to recreate the human intelligence. In the 1950s and
      1960s this promise failed to materialize. Perhaps because the target was
      not only high, but moving: the moment the machine learned to do something
      as well as, or better than, humans, people stopped referring to it as
      “AI”. 人工智能 人工智能 (AI) 最初​​由约翰·麦卡锡 (John McCarthy)
      定义为“制造智能机器，尤其是智能计算机程序的科学与工程”。早期的人工智能研究人员设定了很高的目标：他们旨在重建人类智能。
      在 20 世纪 50 年代和 60
      年代，这一承诺未能实现。或许是因为目标不仅高，而且不断变化：当机器学会做某事与人类一样好或更好时，人们就不再将其称为“AI”。
